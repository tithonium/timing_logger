Really REALLY simplistic timing wrappers.

In a controller:
  time_actions
to log the time to process all actions, or
  time_actions :action, :other_action, :otherother_action
to only watch those.


Inside a function, time a block (pass a 'type' and a description):
  time_block "API CALL", args.inspect do
    do_something(*args)
  end


To wrapper a function you don't control:
  TimingLogger::wrap_function(Some::Other::Module, :the_function)
